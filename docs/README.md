# Squinky Labs modules for VCV Rack

All of our plugins are free and open source. The [instruction manual](booty-shifter.md) describes all of the released modules.

It is also quite easy to clone this repo and build them yourself. In order to do this, however, you must first download and build [VCV Rack itself](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack).

## More information for developers

We wrote up some tips on how to write plugins that don't use too much CPU. That information is in [Writing Efficient Plugins](efficient-plugins.md).

We documented our experiences optimizing VCO-1. They are in [Notes about the creation of Functional VCO-1](vco-optimization.md).

Many of our plugins go to great lengths to avoid aliasing distortion. Here is some more information about that: [Some information about aliasing](aliasing.md).

## Building source

As with all third-party modules for VCV, you must:

* Clone the VCV Rack repo.
* Build Rack from source.
* Clone SquinkyVCV in Rackâ€™s plugins folder.
* `CD SquinkyVCV`
* `make`

Our `Makefile` is currently set up to build for the forthcoming VCV Rack 1.0. If you would like to build for Rack 0.6.x, then edit Makefile here:

```make
# compile for V1 vs 0.6
FLAGS += -D __V1x
```

Remove the __V1x flag and it will build for 0.6.x.

## Unit testing framework

We have reasonably thorough tests for our code, as well as a performance test suite. Some of this might be of interest - it's [here](unit-test.md).

That document describes how to run all the tests.
