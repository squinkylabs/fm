## F4 Filter

F4 is a four pole state variable filter, which is something not seen very often.

The "secret sauce" of F4 is that it has two resonant peaks instead of one. And there is an option to drop a notch in between the peaks. To the most typical sound of F4 is a vaguely vocal sounding sweet.

Like F2, F4 does not sound good when over-driven. So we have tried to keep that from happening. We recommend turn on the built-in limiter, as it keeps it from saturating, and sounds cool.

## Control

**N switch** adds a notch in-between the two peaks in most filter modes.

**Lim** enages the built-in limiters. There is a limiter on each output of F4.

**Q** Filter resonance. But becuase F4 is such a strange filter the Q control doesn't always do what you expect.

**R** controls the distance between the two peaks.
