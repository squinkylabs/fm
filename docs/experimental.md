# Experimental Modules

Usually we have one or two modules that work, but are not ready for release. Often they have very ugly panels, are missing features, aren't tuned yet for performance or playability.

I most cases there are no pre-built binaries for these plugins, you must build them yourself.

Never the less, we encourage the curious to build these, try them out, and report back to us on any bugs or desired features.

## Building experiments

To build all the modules, including the experimental ones, simply run `make _EXP=1`.

## Current experiments

The Thread Booster is quite experimental. It is described [here](thread-booster.md). This one does have a pre-built binary.
