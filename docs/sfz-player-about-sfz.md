# About SFZ

SFZ is a free and open specification for making SFZ Instruments. Since it is free and open, anyone can make an SFZ Instrument and redistribute it without a license or fee. Of course, the samples themselves may have restrictions, so be sure to check before you distribute any samples.

The SFZ specification grew from the Sound Fonts specification. It was developed by Cakewalk, and now it is maintained by a dedicated group of people. Most of the information about SFZ file can be found on their site [here](https://sfzformat.com/).

That site is full of good information. It has tutorials on making SFZ, full specifications of the format, etc. The tutorials are actually a fairly detailed dive into some of the ways an SFZ can be constructed. They can be super useful for getting a feel for what SFZ is really about (under the covers). The "Opcodes" section give a reasonably detailed description of what each SFZ opcode does, and there are hundreds of them.

Support for the SFZ Format can be found in a discord channel. There is a link to if from the SFZ Format site.

Since SFZ has been around for quite a while, there are a lot of free and inexpensive SFZ instrument that may be downloaded. In fact, there are many, many, many SFZ out there to try.
