# This is the new Squinky Labs repo

On September 28th Squinky Labs announced they would not update their modules to VCV rack V2 [here](https://community.vcvrack.com/t/closing-the-squinky-lab/14194/33). As this message was received with lots of grief by the community I decided to pick up the porting and maintanance myself. As I don't pretend to be at the same level as Squinky Labs I hope at least this port will contribute enough to make my work valuable.

Feedback and bug reports (and [donations](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/RPJVCV)) are always appreciated!
